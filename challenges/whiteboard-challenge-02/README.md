# Code Challenge: Binary search in a sorted 1D array
This program uses a function that takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. It then returns the index of the array's element that is equal to the search key.

Example:	
		input: [4,8,15,16,23,42], 15
		output: 2

		input: [11,22,33,44,55,66,77], 90
		output: -1

## Challenge
Create a function that takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. It then returns the index of the array's element that is equal to the search key.
Call the function in the main method and show proof that the function works.
