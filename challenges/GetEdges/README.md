# Whiteboard Challenge 27: Get Edges
This program takes a weighted graph and traverses the nodes to emulate possible 
flight paths. The price of travel is then returned. 
Trips must include 2 or greater nodes, or else a value of 0 will return.


## Challenge
Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, 
and two city names. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available 
to your language, return whether the trip is possible, and how much it would cost.
