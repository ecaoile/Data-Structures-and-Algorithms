# Whiteboard Challenge 08: Merge two linked lists
This program demonstrates two linked lists being merged. The second linked list merges into
the first linked list so that the first linked list becomes the merged linked list.

Example:	
        
    Input
    First Linked list: 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> NULL
    Second Linked list: 4 --> 5 --> 6 --> 7 --> 8 --> NULL

    Output
    The first linked list in merged form: 1 --> 4 --> 2 --> 5 --> 3 --> 6 --> 7 --> 8 --> NULL


## Challenge
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as 
arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes 
alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of 
the single list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have 
access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List 
class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
