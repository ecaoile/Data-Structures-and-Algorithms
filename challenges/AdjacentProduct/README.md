# Code Challenge: Largest product of 2 adjacent values in a 2D array
This program uses a function that takes in 2D array, displays it, and then returns the largest product of 2 adjacent values.

Example:	

	input:   [ 
			[ 1, 2, 1 ], 
			[ 2, 4, 2 ], 
			[ 3, 6, 8 ], 
			[ 7, 8, 1 ] 
		]
	output: 64

## Challenge
Create a function that looks through the entire 2D array and performs calculations to see which product of 2 adjacent elements has the greatest value.
Return the largest product and show proof that it works.
