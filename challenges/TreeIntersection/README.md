# Whiteboard Challenge 32: Tree Intersection
This program takes two binary search trees and returns a list of common 
values between the two BSTs.


## Challenge
- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.
- Stretch goal: Presume you are working with BSTs. How can you improve the performance of your algorithm?
