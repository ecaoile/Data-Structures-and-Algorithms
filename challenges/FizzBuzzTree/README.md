# Whiteboard Challenge 17: Multi-bracket Validation
This program demonstrates "fizzbuzz" being performed on a tree. 
Here are the rules of fizzbuzz:
- a value that is evenly divisible by 3 is replaced with "fizz"
- a value that is evenly divisible by 5 is replaced with "buzz"
- a value that is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 is replaced with "fizzbuzz"

This program displays the original tree as well as 
the state of the tree after the FizzBuzzTree method is invoked on it.

## Challenge
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. 
Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value.
