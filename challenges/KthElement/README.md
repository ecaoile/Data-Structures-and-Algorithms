# Whiteboard Challenge 07: k-th value from the end of a linked list
This program returns the value that is k nodes from the end of a linked list.
It then uses the main method to display the node's corresponding value as
proof of implementation.

Example:	
        
       Linked list:
       12 --> 24 --> 42 --> NULL

		input: k = 0
		output: 42 --> 

		input: k = 2
		output: 12 -->

## Challenge

a linked list.
