# Whiteboard Challenge 12: First-in, First out Animal Shelter
This program demonstrates the use of a queue for an animal shelter,
allowing users to enqueue only cats and dogs and selecting whether
to dequeue a cat or a dog.

## Challenge
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
<br/><br/>
Implement the following methods:

    enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
    dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref, a string, is ‘cat’ return the longest-waiting cat. If pref is ‘dog’, return the longest-waiting dog. For anything else, return either a cat or a dog.
